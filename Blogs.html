        <h2>Want to secure great Internships? IEEE Student’s Branch NIT Durgapur presents</h2>
        <h1>“The Internship Bootcamp”</h1>
        Today all engineers irrespective of their branch or year of study have to face one big challenge: how do you
        increase your chances of securing a good internship be it here or overseas? The answer is deceptively simple
        actually. You stay updated regarding opportunities, apply early and apply to as many places as possible.

        We all dream of securing an internship at our dream company or institute.

        We all know the importance of getting a good internship since it’s the first time you experience the limelight
        of the world (corporate or research ) to which you wish to commit the rest of your life.

        Your internship will prove to be a pivotal point in your career. It gives you real-world experience, enhances
        your network, augments your resume, makes you a master at time management and most importantly you discover new
        things about yourself.

        The internship you pursue is going to be one of the most important building blocks of your career foundation. So
        shouldn’t it match up to your expectations?

        So We, IEEE Students Branch NIT Durgapur, organized “The Internship BootCamp”, which was conducted on the 8th
        and 9th of August, 2018 at DM Sen Conference Hall. The workshop was aimed at providing quality exposure to
        students regarding fellowship opportunities, undergrad projects, and internships in and around the country as
        well as abroad.

        On the first day, the workshop started off with a brief introduction about the IEEE society and its impactful
        mission in providing students a platform to establish their careers. It was followed by a brief presentation
        given by Abhishek Singh, third year, Department of CSE on the various foreign internships open to Indian
        students, their eligibility criteria, and the respective procedures. Having spiked the audience’s attention with
        the right amount of motivation, we launched our ‘Experience Talks’ session where we brought in some of our Final
        Year students who had bagged foreign internships last year and were associated with multiple research projects.
